Deck Aid - A rougelike deckbuilding game inspired by Slay The Spire, being created mainly as a programming exercize to practice Go and to try out the Ebitengine.

TODO:
- Combat loop (in terminal)
- Actual graphics
- Make it an actual rougelike with a map (?) and stuff
- Adding cool new enemies, cards, effects etc
- Lore?
